# Potato-leaf-Disease-Classification
<br>
<ul>
<li>Classification ML model for detecting late and early blight disease in potatoes leaves:</li>
<li>For model building : Tensorflow, CNN, Data Augmentation, tf-dataset.</li>
<li>Matplotlib for getting brief Visualization of Data.</li>
<li>The Dataset is partitioned into 4/5(80%) == training, 1/5(20%) == 1/10(10%)-validation & 1/10(10%)-testing!</li>
<li>And for Data Augmentation : keras layers preprocessing is used.</li>
<li>For Backend purposes : TF serving, FASTAPI and for fetching and comparing of models Docker tfserving container is used.</li>
<li>Frontend : REACT.</li>
</ul>
