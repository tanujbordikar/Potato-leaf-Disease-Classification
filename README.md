# Potato-leaf-Disease-Classification
Classification ML model for detecting late and early blight disease in potatoes leaves:
For model building : Tensorflow, CNN, Data Augmentation, tf-dataset.
Matplotlib for getting brief Visualization of Data.
The Dataset is partitioned into 4/5(80%) == training, 1/5(20%) == 1/10(10%)-validation & 1/10(10%)-testing!
And for Data Augmentation : keras layers preprocessing is used.
For Backend purposes : TF serving, FASTAPI and for fetching and comparing of models Docker tfserving container is used.
Frontend : REACT.
